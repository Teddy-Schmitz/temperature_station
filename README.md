#Temperature Station
Version 1.0

###Overview
An arduino sketch to output temperature and humidity data as well as control a Trane A/C unit using aRest and the ethernet shield.

## Requirements

- Arduino Mega
- IR LED
- Temperature sensor

You might be able to make this work with an Uno but you will need to modify the aRest library to allow sending floats on an Uno or only send integers.
